**Abstract:** Digital Credit is designed using a brand new blockchain architecture by creating a decentralized, verifiable digital credit community and application platform, based on challenge, contest, test, teaching, posting, ranking, achievement, contribution, review and voting, implementation of POA (Proof of Ability), credit evaluation and digital credit actions for members in the community to create a decentralized, trustworthy, easy to use, immutable, autonomous digital credit community and application platform. Digital Credit simplifies the blockchain application development and implements a distributed, decentralized MVC framework: dMVC (decentralized Model-View-Control), which includes: model part: data structure, database and data storage; control part : actions, services, account managements, role and organization managements, tags and categories; Proof of Ability Actions, including: challenges, contests, tests, contributions, teaching, posts, rankings, achievements, reviews, voting, etc. ; digital credit evaluations, digital credit actions (including awarding rewards, issuing loans, approving crowdfunding, allowing sales of tickets, etc.), tokens and smart contracts, and dispute resolutions; Views: Clients, etc. This allows the creation of distributed, decentralized, real, trustworthy, easy to develop, immutable, safe, objective, fair, autonomous, digital credit communities and applications based on POA.

# Background

## Pain points and Challenges in current credit system

1. Current credit reports and scores have limitations: (i) The credit system is often based on the creditor's current income level, payment and repayment records, credit history, number of applications for credit account, etc. It is impossible to completely and objectively evaluate the credit of the creditor. (ii) Once the creditor has made a mistake, such as accidentally forgetting to repay the credit card, it will have a great negative impact on its credit score. (iii) For freelancers who do not have a stable job, or who are in underdeveloped areas, poverty-stricken areas, or social bottoms, even if they have creditability, they often fails to obtain credit based on traditional credit models. (iv) The credit information of the creditor is passive and it cannot improve its credit rating through active actions.

2. Currently, online-based lending, crowd-funding, and ICO are often fraudulent because the financiers or borrowers are falsifying information and their capabilities are incompetent, ultimately causing losses to the funders. The fundamental reason is that funders cannot perform effective assessment and verification of the true identity and true capabilities of creditor.

3. In human resources, such as talent recruitment, often candidates will fictionalize or exaggerate their curriculum vitae and personal abilities. Initial interviews and short-term trial periods often fail to effectively test their true level of competence. When the company discovers the capabilities of recruiters are incompetent, it is often too late: corporate resources have been wasted, and there are numerous cases where companies are unable to recruit the right people in key positions and the company's development is delayed.

4. Some underdeveloped areas, poor people, individuals at lower levels of society, even if there are talented people in them, their talents are often wasted due to their inability to be effectively excavated. Because these people are of low birth and lack of social relations and self-powered display platforms, it is harder to obtain job opportunities and social recognition.

5. In some outsourcing areas, such as software outsourcing, design outsourcing and other outsourcing areas, project consignees often cannot effectively verify and assess the actual level of the recipient and suffer losses.

6. In the field of venture capital investment, investors are often unable to effectively verify and evaluate the true level of capabilities of the start-up entrepreneurs and suffer losses; start-up entrepreneurs who have great ideas and action forces are unable to obtain investment because of lack of social relations and connections.
