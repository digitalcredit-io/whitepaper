**Abstract:** Digital Credit is designed using a brand new blockchain architecture by creating a decentralized, verifiable digital credit community and application platform, based on challenge, contest, test, teaching, posting, ranking, achievement, contribution, review and voting, implementation of POA (Proof of Ability), credit evaluation and digital credit actions for members in the community to create a decentralized, trustworthy, easy to use, immutable, autonomous digital credit community and application platform. Digital Credit simplifies the blockchain application development and implements a distributed, decentralized MVC framework: dMVC (decentralized Model-View-Control), which includes: model part: data structure, database and data storage; control part : actions, services, account managements, role and organization managements, tags and categories; Proof of Ability Actions, including: challenges, contests, tests, contributions, teaching, posts, rankings, achievements, reviews, voting, etc. ; digital credit evaluations, digital credit actions (including awarding rewards, issuing loans, approving crowdfunding, allowing sales of tickets, etc.), tokens and smart contracts, and dispute resolutions; Views: Clients, etc. This allows the creation of distributed, decentralized, real, trustworthy, easy to develop, immutable, safe, objective, fair, autonomous, digital credit communities and applications based on POA.
